Corona Virus Tracker application

This is an application I made using Spring Boot Framework.
The goal of the application is to give updated data based on the data provided daily by John Hopkins University for the new cases of corona.

Used CSV files that contains the daily data can be found here --> https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
